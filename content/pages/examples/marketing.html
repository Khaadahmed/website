      It is very prominent, and is meant as a first level header.
      You should put some supporting text below the header,
      but keep this copy short and clear.
      Below this we can dive into more detail.

You can use highlight sections to provide a horizontal, *prominent*, three point
list of items. One use case might be to explain three similar features.

<div class="ui padded text container">

## Text container

Text containers center and restrict the size of content to a nice, readable
width. These containers are also responsive down to mobile.  It is recommended
that the page width vary for a nicer look.

You'll want to add some classes to your images or they will not scale responsively.

{% endmarkdown %}
</div>


<div class="ui very padded text container">
{% markdown %}

## Container spacing

Vertical spacing is also really important to maintain. The best way to do this
is with padded containers. This provides a break in the content to give the
reader some reference point in the document.

{% endmarkdown %}
</div>


<div class="ui very padded container">
{% markdown %}

## Standard container

Standard containers have a wider width and smaller default text size.
These containers are what you'd use for anything that might be wider and isn't
just prose text content.

Here are some examples of content you might put into this wider container:

{#
  Multiple content columns

  This uses an SUI trick. Use `computer reversed` class on the `ui grid` to
  reverse the column order on desktop sized viewports. On mobile and tablet,
  the grid will stack with the image column first, but on computers it will
  be the right column in a two column layout.

      <div class="ui very padded basic vertical large segment">
{% markdown %}
A two column layout can also work well for supporting text beside some
illustrative content like code examples, video, or image content.

If your page is content heavy, this can be a good way to break up the content
flow and provide some vertical variance in the content width.

<div class="ui very padded text container">
{% markdown %}

## Minor elements

Let's write in markdown for a little while. Here are some of the minor elements
you might include manually on pages:

### Buttons

<a class="ui button" href="https://fomantic-ui.com/elements/button.html">
  <i class="fad fa-books icon"></i>
  Fomantic UI docs on buttons
</a>

The classes `primary`, `secondary`, and color names like `olive`
all control the colors of the buttons. There are plenty of styles to work with
here.

<button href="#" class="ui small primary button" type="button">Primary</button>
<button href="#" class="ui small secondary button" type="button">Secondary</button>
<button href="#" class="ui large olive icon basic button" type="button" aria-label="An olive button">
  <i class="fad fa-olive icon"></i>
</button>

### Icons

We deviate here and instead use Font Awesome Duotone, where SUI uses Font Awesome
Free. So icon definitions look a little different.

<i class="fad fa-cat-space big icon"></i>

    <i class="fad fa-cat-space big icon"></i>

Classes like colors, size, etc all work, but just require the Font Awesome
supplied name instead of the normalized SUI-specific icon names.

### Emoji :man_dancing:

Emoji even work if you want them, though this is not SUI. Duotone icons are
best for most graphic elements though.

### Code

The native Markdown blocks won't look good, but they technically work. This is
because we want some additional elements surrounding the code block to provide
a few more structural elements.

Here's a basic code block:

    import os
    print(os.path)

To get some nice styling, do this instead:

{% endmarkdown %}

{# Stylized code blocks #}
{% call technical.code_block(title="<code>.readthedocs.yaml</code>", icon="fa-file") %}
{% markdown %}

```yaml
version: 2

build:
  os: ubuntu-22.04
  tools:
    python: "3.10"
    nodejs: "14"
  commands:
    - pip install poetry
    - poetry install
    - npm ci
    - poetry run npm run build-html
    - mkdir -p _readthedocs/html/
    - cp -r output/* _readthedocs/html/
```

{% endmarkdown %}
{% endcall %}
