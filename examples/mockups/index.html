                Whenever you push code to your favorite version control system,
                whether that is Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, or Subversion, we will
                automatically build your docs so your code and documentation are
                never out of sync.

                Of course we build and host your docs for the web, but they are
                also vieweable as PDFs, as single page HTML, and for eReaders.
                No additional configuration is required.

              <p>
                We can host and build multiple versions of your docs so having a
                1.0 version of your docs and a 2.0 version of your docs is as easy
                as having a separate branch or tag in your version control system.
